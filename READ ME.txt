About this code:

# Module 2 VACCINATION

IMPORTANT: for Email and SMS fucntion you need to craete essentially a burner Email that you will NOT EVER use for anythin peronal
or importnat. For EMAIL to work with smtlib, ssl the email will need to be non secure. Google the steps for this. Also you must make
